      <h1>&nbsp;What is a testing contest?</h1>

      <p>
         Our unofficial ReactOS Community discord server organises testing contests every time a new ReactOS release is published to the public. A testing contest is a competition which a candidate submits an entry with a tested application (with the following application's name, some screenshots and/or a video). At the end of the competition the community picks the winner by polling. The winner is chosen accordingly by the highest number of votes.
